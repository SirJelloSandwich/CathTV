1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,570
[Steve] Do you think thereâ€™s a spirit world?

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,240
> Oh I know thereâ€™s a spirit world.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,000
>> No, I donâ€™t believe in that.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,399
> Thatâ€™s sort of a weird question.

5
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:11,330
>> Hmmâ€¦Evil influence on an individual?

6
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,639
[Steve] Do you think thereâ€™s a spirit world
out here?

7
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:14,369
> Sure, yeah.

8
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:21,880
[Roy Fouch] Parapsychology is a branch of
psychology that really delves into abnormal

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,000
experiences.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,369
[Steve] Do you think there is anything to
the idea that thereâ€™s a spirit world out

11
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:29,089
there?

12
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:29,820
> No.

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:36,120
[Steve] Whatâ€™s the truth when it comes to
the spirit world? Do spirits really exist?

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,940
Are they active in the world today or is it
all just fantasy?

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:47,539
Stay tuned to Beyond Today as we answer the
question: â€œIs There a Spirit World?â€

16
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:57,829
[Announcer] Join our host Steve Myers and
his guests, as they help you understand your

17
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:00,910
future on Beyond Today!

18
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:07,610
[Steve] The spirit worldâ€”some whole-heartedly
believe in it. Others think only the shallow-minded

19
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:14,229
could be taken in by the idea. Your Bible
says, itâ€™s a fact. What do you think?

20
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:19,470
Letâ€™s take a moment to consider if itâ€™s
real. Many I spoke to on the street seem to

21
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,340
deny the possibility. Is there a spirit world?

22
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,039
> Iâ€™ve never really thought about that,
but...I donâ€™t think so; no, I donâ€™t.

23
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:32,850
>> Not really that Iâ€™ve seen. I really believe
that people make their own decisions and,

24
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,909
you know, if they go a bad way thatâ€™s sort
of on them.

25
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:40,850
> As far as evils spirits, and the whole idea
of Halloween, no.

26
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,009
[Steve] Do you think there is anything to
evil spirits?

27
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,710
> No I donâ€™t.

28
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:51,439
[Steve] Okay, we may feel that way, but can
we really know if thereâ€™s truly a spirit

29
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,170
realm?

30
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,200
Some think that research and science can find
the answer. Well, is it possible for science

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,340
to tell us whether thereâ€™s a real spirit
world?

32
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,579
> If it can be done then Iâ€™m sure science
at some point will do it.

33
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:10,510
[Steve] Do you think science could detect
if thereâ€™s a spirit world?

34
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:14,620
>That would be cool if they could but, I donâ€™t
know right now.

35
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:20,770
>> I consider myself pretty science-based
myself, but there are some things that we

36
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:27,220
havenâ€™t quite explained yet. Iâ€™m not willing
to say thereâ€™s any specific god or spirit

37
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,830
or power but there is something out there
that we havenâ€™t quite put a name on and

38
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,100
really nailed down just yet.

39
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:40,480
[Steve] When you get right down to itâ€”science
isnâ€™t the answer. Most scientists theorize

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,710
that weâ€™re products of evolution. Theyâ€™re
biased against anything thatâ€™s intangible.

41
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:52,120
One man I spoke with is an anthropologist.
Anthropology is the scientific study of human

42
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,680
societies and cultures and their development.
Hereâ€™s what he said:

43
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:03,560
> We in the sort of materialist scientific
age denigrate that sort of thing. The real

44
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:12,020
fact is, that science is the study of stuff
that you can measure and metaphysical stuff,

45
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,830
of course, you canâ€™t measure.

46
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,420
[Steve] Science has little to say about things
that can't be seen under a microscope, through

47
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,830
a telescope or things that can't be examined
in a laboratory. It deals best with the physical

48
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:31,770
world, but science is highly skeptical at
best of anything dealing with the spirit realm.

49
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:39,010
Do you think there is a dimension there that
is real, even though science canâ€™t detect

50
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,290
it?

51
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:45,560
> Oh indeed. Yeah, I do believe that, indeed.
Yeah. Thereâ€™s lots of things that science

52
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,760
canâ€™t measure and the problem that some
scientists have is that things that they canâ€™t

53
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,750
measure they donâ€™t believe is real, but
thereâ€™s lots and lots of evidence.

54
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:02,230
[Steve] What a valuable point! Even though
science canâ€™t identify it, there is a spirit

55
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:07,630
dimension thatâ€™s real. Because they canâ€™t
quantify it, they donâ€™t believe it to be

56
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,570
true.

57
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:14,180
But, is there a source we can turn toâ€”that
gives us trustworthy information about the

58
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,750
spirit world?

59
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,970
Yes. There is a reliable resource that describes
the unseen spirit realm without contradictionsâ€”and

60
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,890
in a logical, consistent manner.

61
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:30,660
Itâ€™s the Bible. Of all the books that deal
with the spirit world, only the Bible has

62
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,120
been shown throughout the centuries to be
dependable. Itâ€™s a dependable source of

63
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,710
information. So, if weâ€™re to learn about
the spirit world, weâ€™ve got to turn to the

64
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,560
truth of the Bible. Go to the source!

65
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,430
The Bible proclaims it was inspired by the
One who is over the entire spirit worldâ€”God

66
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:57,720
Himself! Weâ€™re told: â€œFor by Him all things
were created that are in heaven and that are

67
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,710
on earth, visible and invisible (Colossians
1: 16, NKJ).

68
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,580
Godâ€™s Word is filled with references to
spirit beings that possess intelligence and

69
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,960
moral qualities. When it comes to the evil
spiritual forces, the Bible itself helps us

70
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,340
to stand strong against them.

71
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:22,070
Thereâ€™s a great example of this that occurred
close to 2,000 years ago. The apostle Paul

72
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,650
visited the city of Ephesus and he preached
from the Bible about the truth of God and

73
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:34,090
the wicked spirit realm. The people who had
been using evil materials reacted to his message

74
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,130
by choosing to reject spiritual darkness.

75
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:44,490
The story is found in Acts 19: â€œAlso, many
of those who had practiced magic brought their

76
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:50,530
books together and burned them in the sight
of all. And they counted up the value of them,

77
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:57,310
and it totaled fifty thousand pieces of silver.
So the word of the Lord grew mightily and

78
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,670
prevailedâ€ (Acts 19:19-20).

79
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:05,490
Today, many might think that weâ€™re much
too sophisticated now to be that superstitious

80
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,500
about an evil spirit world.

81
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:14,490
> I think people want to believe thereâ€™s
something higher than just this mortal plane

82
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,129
that we have.

83
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:20,000
>> It may be evil, but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s
a spirit. I think itâ€™s just mentality of

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,800
man.

85
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,760
[Steve] But the Bible proclaims there is an
evil spirit realm. In fact, it calls the world

86
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,050
that we live in: â€œthis present evil worldâ€
(Galatians 1:4).

87
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,990
> I do think there is some greater force out
there but Iâ€™m not sure what it is.

88
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,860
>> It has a definite influence on you.

89
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,780
> If I believe in any kind of spiritual world
at all, itâ€™s something that we all share.

90
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:49,510
[Steve] Do you think itâ€™s possible that
unseen world can impact our thinking?

91
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,560
> Oh I believe so, very definitely. Yeah,
very definitely.

92
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,770
[Steve] The Word of God reveals it is a dominant
force that stands against the powers of evil.

93
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:04,980
Yet, most are unable to see and fall under
another power and its influence.

94
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,800
What is the source of spiritual blindness?
Well up next, weâ€™ll discover what the Bible

95
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,340
says about this evil spirit world and what
you can do to overcome its influence.

96
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,800
But first, let me tell you about our revealing,
free study aid that can help you understand

97
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,710
the spirit influences on our world: Is There
Really a Devil?

98
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:30,550
Is there a being that wants you to believe
a lie? Could the disorder and chaos in our

99
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,680
world be connected to spiritual influence?
Have you been swayed to think that demons

100
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,150
are simply just myths?

101
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,060
Our free study guide, Is There Really a Devil?
will give you insight into these and many

102
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:49,280
other questions. The Bible speaks of the reality
of a dark spirit world. It reveals how someone

103
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,550
could be persuaded to follow hurtful, destructive
ways.

104
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,520
Youâ€™ll also discover how you can stand up
against deception through the very power of

105
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,510
God.

Cincinnati, OH 45254].

110
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,880
Many question the idea of a spirit realm impacting
our modern world. Is that primitive thinking

111
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,610
or a valid certainty?

112
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,019
Do you think there could be an unseen world
that could impact the way we think?

113
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:37,430
> I feel like there is some kind of something
out there, but I canâ€™t describe it.

114
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,500
>> Then we donâ€™t know why certain things
happen. We canâ€™t explain everything.

115
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:47,440
> Iâ€™m a retired anthropologist and virtually
every culture acknowledges a spirit world.

116
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,860
[Steve] Do you think there could be anything
to an evil influence that would affect even

117
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,860
nations?

118
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,870
> That I donâ€™t believe.

119
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,610
>> Iâ€™ve always kinda felt that there were
spirits of some kind, but whether or not thatâ€™s

120
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,900
true or if itâ€™s just in my head, I have
noâ€¦ I donâ€™t think anybody knows, do they?

121
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:11,810
[Steve] Do you think it could go to the extent
that spirit influence could affect even nations?

122
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:17,230
> Yeah, certainly I believe that. Yeah, it
affects us all individually and of course

123
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,570
nations are just a bunch of individuals.

124
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,710
>> Whether we are influenced whether we have
a thought, where does that thought come from?

125
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,670
I donâ€™t know.

126
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:29,050
[Steve] Well letâ€™s think about that for
a moment. Can it be explained? Is it just

127
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:37,810
in our head? From where does it come? Could
a spirit entity really influence you?

128
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,940
To answer the question, we have to start at
the creation of the spirit world.

129
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,460
First, God tells us that He created angels
before the existence of the earth as spirit

130
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,770
beings who cannot die (Hebrews 1:7). They
are described in the Bible as good and righteous

131
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:57,540
angels who shouted for joy when they saw the
earth being created (Job 38:4-7).

132
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:03,920
Well, God made these holy angels to protect
and take care of people. Psalm 91:11 tells

133
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,070
us that God â€œshall give His angels charge
over you, to keep you in all your ways.â€

134
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:16,560
You see, God gives us powerful angelic help
for our benefit. Now imagine that! They come

135
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,170
to the aid of humans in fulfilling God's plan
of salvation (Hebrews 1:14).

136
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:26,980
Now, letâ€™s consider whether an evil spirit
entity can really influence you.

137
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,730
There could be other influences at certain
times as well?

138
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,420
> Yeah I think there are probably some evil
spirits as well as some very good spirits.

139
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,800
>> So we can, we really donâ€™t know what
influences our decisions. It could be our

140
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,980
thought process, whatâ€™s in our heart, the
way we were raised. You notice a whole lot

141
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,990
of factors that go in. I just think thatâ€™s
a cop out when somebody say, â€œoh, the devil

142
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,770
made me do it.â€

143
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:54,370
[Steve] People do bad things and itâ€™s because
thereâ€™s a devil out there thatâ€™s impacting

144
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,460
people. I mean, what would you say if somebody
said that?

145
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:03,310
> That there could be. I donâ€™t know for
sure, but there could be.

146
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:07,460
>> If thereâ€™s any kind of evil itâ€™s just
sort of turning away from that idea that we

147
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,970
are all humans at the base of it.

148
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:16,940
[Steve] Is it simply people making bad choices?
Evil people choosing wrong?

149
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,410
The Bible describes it differently. It reveals
a dark realm.

150
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:27,990
Now weâ€™ve already recognized that God created
the spirit world to be good. So how did the

151
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,080
dark side arise?

152
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:37,100
The Bible tells us that evil began with one
of those created angels called Lucifer. He

153
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:43,990
chose to rebel against God. This was the beginning
of wickedness and sin.

154
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:49,720
God Himself described what happened: â€œYou
were the anointed cherub who covers; I established

155
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,980
you; you were on the holy mountain of God...You
were perfect in your ways from the day you

156
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:01,399
were created, till iniquity was found in you...You
became filled with violence within, and you

157
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:07,430
sinned...Your heart was lifted up because
of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom

158
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,660
for the sake of your splendor...â€ (Ezekiel
28:14-17).

159
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:17,160
So God created angels with free will, given
the choice to choose between good and evil.

160
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:23,580
They were also capable of sin. But Lucifer
defied God along with other angels and he

161
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:30,420
was changed forever. He became Satanâ€”the
â€œAdversary.â€ This was the origin of the

162
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,730
dark side of the spirit world. He is the great
liar â€œwho deceives the whole worldâ€ (Revelation

163
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:41,339
12:9) and, along with his angelsâ€”now demons,
heâ€™s an expert of disguise.

164
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:47,790
Weâ€™re warned not to be fooled. â€œFor Satan
himself transforms himself into an angel of

165
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:54,700
light. Therefore it is no great thing if his
ministers also transform themselves into ministers

166
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:00,770
of righteousness, whose end will be according
to their worksâ€ (2 Corinthians 11:14-15).

167
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:05,589
Unfortunately, many are skeptical and just
donâ€™t believe it. Iâ€™ve talked to so many

168
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:12,180
people lately that have told me that Satan
doesnâ€™t exist. Demonsâ€”theyâ€™re pure fantasy

169
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,410
and there is no spirit world.

170
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:22,480
But wait, Satan is no mere metaphor. Hereâ€™s
just how serious it is: â€œFor we do not wrestle

171
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,740
against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
against powers, against the rulers of the

172
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,610
darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts
of wickednessâ€ (Ephesians 6:12).

173
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:41,300
So, whether weâ€™re aware of it or not, whether
we believe it or not; there is a great spiritual

174
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,670
battle going on.

175
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,640
What would you say to somebody that said,
â€œWell that must be evil thatâ€™s influencing

176
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,140
thatâ€?

177
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,910
> It may be evil but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s
a spirit.

178
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,540
>> In every culture there are stories of evil,
right? And so they influence... thereâ€™s

179
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,330
a belief that something is influencing people.

180
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:04,760
[Steve] Sheâ€™s right! God inspired the apostle
Paul to explain how Satan operates. He influences

181
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:11,140
people by transmitting invisible, powerful
negative attitudes: â€œ... you once walked

182
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,790
according to the course of this world, according
to the prince of the power of the air, the

183
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:22,140
spirit who now works in the sons of disobedienceâ€¦â€
(Ephesians 2:1-3).

184
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:27,140
Have you ever noticed a struggle going on
in your own mind? You have positive and negative

185
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:33,339
attitudes, good and bad thoughts. And have
you ever felt them battle it out for dominance

186
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,029
to impact how you act?

187
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:41,680
Well the Bible reveals that Satan has that
power to impact our thinking. The devil has

188
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:49,080
the ability to broadcast destructive attitudes
as he tries to persuade us to do wrong. Itâ€™s

189
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,480
real. Itâ€™s dangerous. And itâ€™s deadly.

190
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,640
Up next, Iâ€™ll speak with a clinical counselor
about this battle for our minds. Can Satan

191
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,529
read your mind and take control of you? Weâ€™ll
look at that in just a moment.

192

210
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:43,240
Is there really a spirit world? Yes. And whether
or not youâ€™re aware of it, a spiritual battle

211
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:49,470
is going onâ€”a battle for our minds. So even
though weâ€™re physical people, thereâ€™s

212
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,019
a supernatural conflict thatâ€™s happening
right now.

213
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:58,459
Godâ€™s Word tells us that: â€œ...though we
live in the world we are not carrying on a

214
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:03,769
worldly warâ€ (2 Corinthians 10:3, RSV).
Itâ€™s certainly not a physical conflict.

215
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:09,799
Weâ€™re reminded of the powerful forces that
we combat in our thoughts: â€œKeep your mind

216
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:15,600
clear, and be alert. Your opponent the devil
is prowling around like a roaring lion as

217
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,749
he looks for someone to devourâ€ (1 Peter
5:8, GW).

218
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:24,480
I spoke with Dr. Roy Fouch, a Licensed Professional
Clinical Counselor about this spiritual warfare

219
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,639
and the impact of the spirit world upon our
thinking.

220
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:31,419
Now as a clinical counselor, do you believe
in a spirit world?

221
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:36,309
[Dr. Fouch] Oh yes, absolutely. First of all,
I believe in the Bible and what the Bible

222
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:42,470
has to say. And the Bible clearly says there
is a spirit world and that there are evil

223
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:50,210
spirit beings and that they do interact with
human beings. We see the effects of evil in

224
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:57,480
our culture today. So there is evil and the
Bible talks about it. And, we all are affected

225
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,609
by it in one way or another, if not directly.
But we also can open ourselves up to the influence

226
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:08,350
if weâ€™re not doing the kind of things that
we need to do to counteract that part of the

227
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,359
spirit world.

228
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:16,169
[Steve] That is the challengeâ€”counteracting
the dark influences that are all around us.

229
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:22,009
It begins with subtle suggestion and enticement.
An evil thought is introduced into our mind,

230
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:28,710
and if we donâ€™t change our thinking, the
desire motivates us to pursue it. The apostle

231
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:34,840
James said it this way: â€œBut each one is
tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires

232
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:41,269
and enticed. Then, when desire has conceived,
it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is

233
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:49,129
full-grown, brings forth deathâ€ (James 1:14-15).
So we have to change the way we think.

234
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:55,779
Now unfortunately throughout the centuries,
many have confused mental illness with demonic

235
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:56,059
influence.

236
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:01,710
[Dr. Fouch] Iâ€™ve been working in the field
with the severely, mentally ill for 35 years.

237
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:10,070
These people suffer terrible lives in many
cases. Itâ€™s important to not necessarily

238
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:16,679
assume that they are being influenced by demons
or that they are possessed. That we treat

239
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:22,330
them as we would treat anybody who is suffering
from any condition. Throughout history people

240
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:28,690
have been confounded by what mental illness
is. And so, theyâ€™ve reacted to these individuals

241
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:34,529
as if they were demon possessed. They would
do things like bloodletting and drilling holes

242
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:38,259
in their heads to try to release the evil
spirits.

243
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:45,070
Thomas Aquinas, back in the 12th century,
a theologian, believed that it had to do with

244
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:50,269
demon possession or demon influence. And,
so what has happened through the course of

245
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:54,570
time, some of these beliefs have continued
down through the ages.

246
00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:00,409
[Steve] We have to be careful about what we
assume. Godâ€™s Word teaches that evil forces

247
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:06,179
can potentially influence all of us. Thatâ€™s
because Satan has the ability to transmit

248
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:11,519
attitudes and tempting thoughts from which
no one is immune.

249
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,739
Have you ever found yourself thinking an evil
thought and wondered, â€œWhere did that come

250
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:22,619
from?â€ Weâ€™ve all heard the excuse, â€œThe
devil made me do it!â€ But the truth is,

251
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:29,979
the devil canâ€™t make you do anything. But
he can make something wrongâ€”sound goodâ€”or

252
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:35,659
seem so appealing, that youâ€™re willing to
choose to do it on your own. Maybe the saying

253
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:40,600
should be: â€œThe devil tempted me to do it,
and I gave in.â€

254
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,479
[Dr. Fouch] You donâ€™t have to have a mental
illness to be influenced by demons. And I

255
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:52,919
do think that people who have mental illness
are much more vulnerable to those influences

256
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,999
because they donâ€™t seem to have much control
over the thoughts that come into their mind.

257
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:03,229
[Steve] Do you think it would be fair to say
that itâ€™s not always chemical imbalances.

258
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:08,440
That there actually is something for some
that is an effect of the spirit world?

259
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,879
[Dr. Fouch] Oh, absolutely. Not only people
with mental illness, but other people. So

260
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:19,519
we can actually open that door ourselves by
some of the choices that we make.

261
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:24,409
[Steve] Have you thought about some of the
ways that we open up ourselves to potential

262
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:31,070
influences? Is there a door in your life that
youâ€™re leaving open? Remember, itâ€™s about

263
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,889
your mind.

264
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:42,080
[Dr. Fouch] I believe that when you talk about
ghosts, and things of that nature, and witches,

265
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,149
and things along those linesâ€”things around
the occult, witchcraft, things like thatâ€”youâ€™re

266
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:55,419
definitely delving into the darker, spiritual
world. And, these things are presented in

267
00:21:55,419 --> 00:22:00,489
such an attractive way, that our children
are drawn to them and we encourage our children

268
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:06,580
to be drawn to them. And these are things
that are part of the demonic world. Itâ€™s

269
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:13,600
part of the darker side of spirituality and
what Satan tries to do in my mind, is to sort

270
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:21,769
of dress it upâ€”make it looks like itâ€™s
fun, make it looks like itâ€™s okay. And yet,

271
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:26,749
there are off shoots of this. So when you
start going in that direction, then you are

272
00:22:26,749 --> 00:22:34,639
definitely opening yourself up to demonic
influences. The more you access and interact

273
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:40,090
with the spirit world on the dark side, the
more chance there is that something could

274
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,190
get terribly out of control.

275
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:47,769
[Steve] But remember, itâ€™s not just about
ghosts and witches and the occult. The Bible

276
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:53,320
leaves no doubt that Jesus believed that the
devil and demons exist and that they have

277
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,179
evil influence in and over human beings.

278
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:02,869
Christ knew that these powers of darkness
are terrible forces of evil. No wonder He

279
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:09,350
spoke of them with intensity and with authority.
He didnâ€™t hesitate to proclaim that evil

280
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:14,539
can be in our hearts and minds and it can
come from the very source of evil: Satan the

281
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:15,759
devil.

282
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:21,279
And so He warns us so we wonâ€™t be fooled.
Itâ€™s clear that: â€œThe devil who rules

283
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:27,239
this world has blinded the minds of those
who do not believeâ€ (2 Corinthians 4, NCV).

284
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:32,830
Now as strange as it may seem, heâ€™s convinced
people that he doesnâ€™t even exist and even

285
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:37,929
deceived the majority of people into false
religious worship. Theyâ€™ve perverted the

286
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:45,729
knowledge of the One true Godâ€”even within
Christianity! Jesus taught us: Donâ€™t underestimate

287
00:23:45,729 --> 00:23:48,379
Satan and his demons.

288
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:52,720
But it doesnâ€™t have to be that way. You
can protect yourself from the darkness around

289
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,950
you as you draw close to God.

290
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,509
[Dr. Fouch] If weâ€™re going to be influenced
one way or the other, I believe, because I

291
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:05,379
think the spirit world does interact with
our physical realm. And so, if weâ€™re focused

292
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:11,440
on connecting with the positive sideâ€”as
a Christian that would be connecting with

293
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,429
Jesus Christ, connecting with God the Father,
trying to follow Their instructions of how

294
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:26,389
to become more like Themâ€”that that will
protect us. And making sure that you are constantly

295
00:24:26,389 --> 00:24:32,419
putting into your mind the things that God
talks about and thinks about. I think if we

296
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:37,059
have minds that are more in tune with God,
there is less chance for our minds to be in

297
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:45,849
tune with the dark side. If we are engaging
in sin on a regular basisâ€”pornography, addictions,

298
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:52,519
drinking too much, doing things of that nature;
sinningâ€”I think anyone is more vulnerable

299
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:53,479
to influence.

300
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:59,409
[Steve] You can be receptive and choose to
let those wrong thoughts penetrate your thinking

301
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:06,359
or you can choose to be different. All are
told to resist the dark forces of the spirit

302
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:12,899
realm and â€œlet God transform you into a
new person by changing the way you think.

303
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:18,559
Then you will learn to know Godâ€™s will for
you, which is good and pleasing and perfectâ€

304
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,119
(Romans 12:2, NLT).

305
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:25,080
Changing our thinking starts with repentance
and asking God to forgive us and to give us

306
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,789
the strength to overcome.

307
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:33,700
So make the commitment today. Turn from the
darkness and ask God to help you build a strong

308
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,639
relationship with Him in the light.Â

316
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,919
journey. We have hundreds of congregations
around the United States and across the world.

00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:32,359

If youâ€™re looking for a home that encourages
living what the Word of God really teaches,

321
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:43,129
youâ€™ve found the right place! Weâ€™re a
familyâ€”a family of Bible believers committed

322
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:49,299
to following Jesus Christ in everything we
do. Weâ€™ve found Godâ€™s way is the best

323
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:50,559
way to live.

324
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,039
Weâ€™re happy that youâ€™re looking into what
God is doing in our efforts to bring His message

325
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,559
to the world. God is certainly pleased that
youâ€™re looking into knowing Him better.

328
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:16,909
[Steve] Even though we canâ€™t see it, the
spirit world is very real. We know that Jesus

329
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:23,950
battled the powers of darkness and He won.
We can, too. He sacrificed His life so that

330
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,960
we may live a life free from the spiritual
hosts of wickedness.

331
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,239
Now in this spiritual battle, letâ€™s make
the choice to fight against anything and everything

332
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:35,809
that even hints of darkness.

333
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:41,479
With His help, we can turn away from evil
influence to our loving God and the truth

334
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:43,330
of His Word.

335
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:47,679
