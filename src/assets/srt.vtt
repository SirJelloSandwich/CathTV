00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.570
[Steve] Do you think thereâ€™s a spirit world?

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.240
> Oh I know thereâ€™s a spirit world.

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.000
>> No, I donâ€™t believe in that.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.399
> Thatâ€™s sort of a weird question.

5
00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:11.330
>> Hmmâ€¦Evil influence on an individual?

6
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.639
[Steve] Do you think thereâ€™s a spirit world
out here?

7
00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:14.369
> Sure, yeah.

8
00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:21.880
[Roy Fouch] Parapsychology is a branch of
psychology that really delves into abnormal

9
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.000
experiences.

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.369
[Steve] Do you think there is anything to
the idea that thereâ€™s a spirit world out

11
00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.089
there?

12
00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.820
> No.

13
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.120
[Steve] Whatâ€™s the truth when it comes to
the spirit world? Do spirits really exist?

14
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.940
Are they active in the world today or is it
all just fantasy?

15
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.539
Stay tuned to Beyond Today as we answer the
question: â€œIs There a Spirit World?â€

16
00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:57.829
[Announcer] Join our host Steve Myers and
his guests, as they help you understand your

17
00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.910
future on Beyond Today!

18
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.610
[Steve] The spirit worldâ€”some whole-heartedly
believe in it. Others think only the shallow-minded

19
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.229
could be taken in by the idea. Your Bible
says, itâ€™s a fact. What do you think?

20
00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.470
Letâ€™s take a moment to consider if itâ€™s
real. Many I spoke to on the street seem to

21
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.340
deny the possibility. Is there a spirit world?

22
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.039
> Iâ€™ve never really thought about that,
but...I donâ€™t think so; no, I donâ€™t.

23
00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:32.850
>> Not really that Iâ€™ve seen. I really believe
that people make their own decisions and,

24
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.909
you know, if they go a bad way thatâ€™s sort
of on them.

25
00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.850
> As far as evils spirits, and the whole idea
of Halloween, no.

26
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.009
[Steve] Do you think there is anything to
evil spirits?

27
00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.710
> No I donâ€™t.

28
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.439
[Steve] Okay, we may feel that way, but can
we really know if thereâ€™s truly a spirit

29
00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.170
realm?

30
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.200
Some think that research and science can find
the answer. Well, is it possible for science

31
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.340
to tell us whether thereâ€™s a real spirit
world?

32
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.579
> If it can be done then Iâ€™m sure science
at some point will do it.

33
00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.510
[Steve] Do you think science could detect
if thereâ€™s a spirit world?

34
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.620
>That would be cool if they could but, I donâ€™t
know right now.

35
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.770
>> I consider myself pretty science-based
myself, but there are some things that we

36
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.220
havenâ€™t quite explained yet. Iâ€™m not willing
to say thereâ€™s any specific god or spirit

37
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.830
or power but there is something out there
that we havenâ€™t quite put a name on and

38
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.100
really nailed down just yet.

39
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.480
[Steve] When you get right down to itâ€”science
isnâ€™t the answer. Most scientists theorize

40
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.710
that weâ€™re products of evolution. Theyâ€™re
biased against anything thatâ€™s intangible.

41
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.120
One man I spoke with is an anthropologist.
Anthropology is the scientific study of human

42
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.680
societies and cultures and their development.
Hereâ€™s what he said:

43
00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.560
> We in the sort of materialist scientific
age denigrate that sort of thing. The real

44
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:12.020
fact is, that science is the study of stuff
that you can measure and metaphysical stuff,

45
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.830
of course, you canâ€™t measure.

46
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.420
[Steve] Science has little to say about things
that can't be seen under a microscope, through

47
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.830
a telescope or things that can't be examined
in a laboratory. It deals best with the physical

48
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:31.770
world, but science is highly skeptical at
best of anything dealing with the spirit realm.

49
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:39.010
Do you think there is a dimension there that
is real, even though science canâ€™t detect

50
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.290
it?

51
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.560
> Oh indeed. Yeah, I do believe that, indeed.
Yeah. Thereâ€™s lots of things that science

52
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.760
canâ€™t measure and the problem that some
scientists have is that things that they canâ€™t

53
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.750
measure they donâ€™t believe is real, but
thereâ€™s lots and lots of evidence.

54
00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.230
[Steve] What a valuable point! Even though
science canâ€™t identify it, there is a spirit

55
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.630
dimension thatâ€™s real. Because they canâ€™t
quantify it, they donâ€™t believe it to be

56
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.570
true.

57
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.180
But, is there a source we can turn toâ€”that
gives us trustworthy information about the

58
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.750
spirit world?

59
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.970
Yes. There is a reliable resource that describes
the unseen spirit realm without contradictionsâ€”and

60
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.890
in a logical, consistent manner.

61
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.660
Itâ€™s the Bible. Of all the books that deal
with the spirit world, only the Bible has

62
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.120
been shown throughout the centuries to be
dependable. Itâ€™s a dependable source of

63
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.710
information. So, if weâ€™re to learn about
the spirit world, weâ€™ve got to turn to the

64
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.560
truth of the Bible. Go to the source!

65
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.430
The Bible proclaims it was inspired by the
One who is over the entire spirit worldâ€”God

66
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:57.720
Himself! Weâ€™re told: â€œFor by Him all things
were created that are in heaven and that are

67
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.710
on earth, visible and invisible (Colossians
1: 16, NKJ).

68
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.580
Godâ€™s Word is filled with references to
spirit beings that possess intelligence and

69
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.960
moral qualities. When it comes to the evil
spiritual forces, the Bible itself helps us

70
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.340
to stand strong against them.

71
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.070
Thereâ€™s a great example of this that occurred
close to 2,000 years ago. The apostle Paul

72
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.650
visited the city of Ephesus and he preached
from the Bible about the truth of God and

73
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.090
the wicked spirit realm. The people who had
been using evil materials reacted to his message

74
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.130
by choosing to reject spiritual darkness.

75
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:44.490
The story is found in Acts 19: â€œAlso, many
of those who had practiced magic brought their

76
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.530
books together and burned them in the sight
of all. And they counted up the value of them,

77
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:57.310
and it totaled fifty thousand pieces of silver.
So the word of the Lord grew mightily and

78
00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.670
prevailedâ€ (Acts 19:19-20).

79
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:05.490
Today, many might think that weâ€™re much
too sophisticated now to be that superstitious

80
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.500
about an evil spirit world.

81
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.490
> I think people want to believe thereâ€™s
something higher than just this mortal plane

82
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.129
that we have.

83
00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:20.000
>> It may be evil, but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s
a spirit. I think itâ€™s just mentality of

84
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.800
man.

85
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.760
[Steve] But the Bible proclaims there is an
evil spirit realm. In fact, it calls the world

86
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.050
that we live in: â€œthis present evil worldâ€
(Galatians 1:4).

87
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.990
> I do think there is some greater force out
there but Iâ€™m not sure what it is.

88
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.860
>> It has a definite influence on you.

89
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.780
> If I believe in any kind of spiritual world
at all, itâ€™s something that we all share.

90
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:49.510
[Steve] Do you think itâ€™s possible that
unseen world can impact our thinking?

91
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.560
> Oh I believe so, very definitely. Yeah,
very definitely.

92
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.770
[Steve] The Word of God reveals it is a dominant
force that stands against the powers of evil.

93
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.980
Yet, most are unable to see and fall under
another power and its influence.

94
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.800
What is the source of spiritual blindness?
Well up next, weâ€™ll discover what the Bible

95
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.340
says about this evil spirit world and what
you can do to overcome its influence.

96
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.800
But first, let me tell you about our revealing,
free study aid that can help you understand

97
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.710
the spirit influences on our world: Is There
Really a Devil?

98
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:30.550
Is there a being that wants you to believe
a lie? Could the disorder and chaos in our

99
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.680
world be connected to spiritual influence?
Have you been swayed to think that demons

100
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.150
are simply just myths?

101
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:43.060
Our free study guide, Is There Really a Devil?
will give you insight into these and many

102
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:49.280
other questions. The Bible speaks of the reality
of a dark spirit world. It reveals how someone

103
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.550
could be persuaded to follow hurtful, destructive
ways.

104
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:57.520
Youâ€™ll also discover how you can stand up
against deception through the very power of

105
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.510
God.

Cincinnati, OH 45254].

110
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.880
Many question the idea of a spirit realm impacting
our modern world. Is that primitive thinking

111
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.610
or a valid certainty?

112
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:32.019
Do you think there could be an unseen world
that could impact the way we think?

113
00:08:32.019 --> 00:08:37.430
> I feel like there is some kind of something
out there, but I canâ€™t describe it.

114
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.500
>> Then we donâ€™t know why certain things
happen. We canâ€™t explain everything.

115
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:47.440
> Iâ€™m a retired anthropologist and virtually
every culture acknowledges a spirit world.

116
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.860
[Steve] Do you think there could be anything
to an evil influence that would affect even

117
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.860
nations?

118
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.870
> That I donâ€™t believe.

119
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:58.610
>> Iâ€™ve always kinda felt that there were
spirits of some kind, but whether or not thatâ€™s

120
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.900
true or if itâ€™s just in my head, I have
noâ€¦ I donâ€™t think anybody knows, do they?

121
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:11.810
[Steve] Do you think it could go to the extent
that spirit influence could affect even nations?

122
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:17.230
> Yeah, certainly I believe that. Yeah, it
affects us all individually and of course

123
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.570
nations are just a bunch of individuals.

124
00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.710
>> Whether we are influenced whether we have
a thought, where does that thought come from?

125
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.670
I donâ€™t know.

126
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:29.050
[Steve] Well letâ€™s think about that for
a moment. Can it be explained? Is it just

127
00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:37.810
in our head? From where does it come? Could
a spirit entity really influence you?

128
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.940
To answer the question, we have to start at
the creation of the spirit world.

129
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:47.460
First, God tells us that He created angels
before the existence of the earth as spirit

130
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.770
beings who cannot die (Hebrews 1:7). They
are described in the Bible as good and righteous

131
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:57.540
angels who shouted for joy when they saw the
earth being created (Job 38:4-7).

132
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:03.920
Well, God made these holy angels to protect
and take care of people. Psalm 91:11 tells

133
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:10.070
us that God â€œshall give His angels charge
over you, to keep you in all your ways.â€

134
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:16.560
You see, God gives us powerful angelic help
for our benefit. Now imagine that! They come

135
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.170
to the aid of humans in fulfilling God's plan
of salvation (Hebrews 1:14).

136
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:26.980
Now, letâ€™s consider whether an evil spirit
entity can really influence you.

137
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.730
There could be other influences at certain
times as well?

138
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:34.420
> Yeah I think there are probably some evil
spirits as well as some very good spirits.

139
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.800
>> So we can, we really donâ€™t know what
influences our decisions. It could be our

140
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.980
thought process, whatâ€™s in our heart, the
way we were raised. You notice a whole lot

141
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.990
of factors that go in. I just think thatâ€™s
a cop out when somebody say, â€œoh, the devil

142
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.770
made me do it.â€

143
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:54.370
[Steve] People do bad things and itâ€™s because
thereâ€™s a devil out there thatâ€™s impacting

144
00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.460
people. I mean, what would you say if somebody
said that?

145
00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:03.310
> That there could be. I donâ€™t know for
sure, but there could be.

146
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:07.460
>> If thereâ€™s any kind of evil itâ€™s just
sort of turning away from that idea that we

147
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.970
are all humans at the base of it.

148
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:16.940
[Steve] Is it simply people making bad choices?
Evil people choosing wrong?

149
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.410
The Bible describes it differently. It reveals
a dark realm.

150
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:27.990
Now weâ€™ve already recognized that God created
the spirit world to be good. So how did the

151
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.080
dark side arise?

152
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:37.100
The Bible tells us that evil began with one
of those created angels called Lucifer. He

153
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:43.990
chose to rebel against God. This was the beginning
of wickedness and sin.

154
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:49.720
God Himself described what happened: â€œYou
were the anointed cherub who covers; I established

155
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.980
you; you were on the holy mountain of God...You
were perfect in your ways from the day you

156
00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:01.399
were created, till iniquity was found in you...You
became filled with violence within, and you

157
00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:07.430
sinned...Your heart was lifted up because
of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom

158
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.660
for the sake of your splendor...â€ (Ezekiel
28:14-17).

159
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:17.160
So God created angels with free will, given
the choice to choose between good and evil.

160
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:23.580
They were also capable of sin. But Lucifer
defied God along with other angels and he

161
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:30.420
was changed forever. He became Satanâ€”the
â€œAdversary.â€ This was the origin of the

162
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:35.730
dark side of the spirit world. He is the great
liar â€œwho deceives the whole worldâ€ (Revelation

163
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:41.339
12:9) and, along with his angelsâ€”now demons,
heâ€™s an expert of disguise.

164
00:12:41.339 --> 00:12:47.790
Weâ€™re warned not to be fooled. â€œFor Satan
himself transforms himself into an angel of

165
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:54.700
light. Therefore it is no great thing if his
ministers also transform themselves into ministers

166
00:12:54.700 --> 00:13:00.770
of righteousness, whose end will be according
to their worksâ€ (2 Corinthians 11:14-15).

167
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:05.589
Unfortunately, many are skeptical and just
donâ€™t believe it. Iâ€™ve talked to so many

168
00:13:05.589 --> 00:13:12.180
people lately that have told me that Satan
doesnâ€™t exist. Demonsâ€”theyâ€™re pure fantasy

169
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.410
and there is no spirit world.

170
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:22.480
But wait, Satan is no mere metaphor. Hereâ€™s
just how serious it is: â€œFor we do not wrestle

171
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:28.740
against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
against powers, against the rulers of the

172
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:34.610
darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts
of wickednessâ€ (Ephesians 6:12).

173
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:41.300
So, whether weâ€™re aware of it or not, whether
we believe it or not; there is a great spiritual

174
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.670
battle going on.

175
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.640
What would you say to somebody that said,
â€œWell that must be evil thatâ€™s influencing

176
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.140
thatâ€?

177
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.910
> It may be evil but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s
a spirit.

178
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:54.540
>> In every culture there are stories of evil,
right? And so they influence... thereâ€™s

179
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.330
a belief that something is influencing people.

180
00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:04.760
[Steve] Sheâ€™s right! God inspired the apostle
Paul to explain how Satan operates. He influences

181
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:11.140
people by transmitting invisible, powerful
negative attitudes: â€œ... you once walked

182
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:16.790
according to the course of this world, according
to the prince of the power of the air, the

183
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:22.140
spirit who now works in the sons of disobedienceâ€¦â€
(Ephesians 2:1-3).

184
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:27.140
Have you ever noticed a struggle going on
in your own mind? You have positive and negative

185
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:33.339
attitudes, good and bad thoughts. And have
you ever felt them battle it out for dominance

186
00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:35.029
to impact how you act?

187
00:14:35.029 --> 00:14:41.680
Well the Bible reveals that Satan has that
power to impact our thinking. The devil has

188
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:49.080
the ability to broadcast destructive attitudes
as he tries to persuade us to do wrong. Itâ€™s

189
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:54.480
real. Itâ€™s dangerous. And itâ€™s deadly.

190
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:59.640
Up next, Iâ€™ll speak with a clinical counselor
about this battle for our minds. Can Satan

191
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:04.529
read your mind and take control of you? Weâ€™ll
look at that in just a moment.

192

210
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:43.240
Is there really a spirit world? Yes. And whether
or not youâ€™re aware of it, a spiritual battle

211
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:49.470
is going onâ€”a battle for our minds. So even
though weâ€™re physical people, thereâ€™s

212
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:53.019
a supernatural conflict thatâ€™s happening
right now.

213
00:16:53.019 --> 00:16:58.459
Godâ€™s Word tells us that: â€œ...though we
live in the world we are not carrying on a

214
00:16:58.459 --> 00:17:03.769
worldly warâ€ (2 Corinthians 10:3, RSV).
Itâ€™s certainly not a physical conflict.

215
00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:09.799
Weâ€™re reminded of the powerful forces that
we combat in our thoughts: â€œKeep your mind

216
00:17:09.799 --> 00:17:15.600
clear, and be alert. Your opponent the devil
is prowling around like a roaring lion as

217
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.749
he looks for someone to devourâ€ (1 Peter
5:8, GW).

218
00:17:18.749 --> 00:17:24.480
I spoke with Dr. Roy Fouch, a Licensed Professional
Clinical Counselor about this spiritual warfare

219
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.639
and the impact of the spirit world upon our
thinking.

220
00:17:27.639 --> 00:17:31.419
Now as a clinical counselor, do you believe
in a spirit world?

221
00:17:31.419 --> 00:17:36.309
[Dr. Fouch] Oh yes, absolutely. First of all,
I believe in the Bible and what the Bible

222
00:17:36.309 --> 00:17:42.470
has to say. And the Bible clearly says there
is a spirit world and that there are evil

223
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:50.210
spirit beings and that they do interact with
human beings. We see the effects of evil in

224
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:57.480
our culture today. So there is evil and the
Bible talks about it. And, we all are affected

225
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:03.609
by it in one way or another, if not directly.
But we also can open ourselves up to the influence

226
00:18:03.609 --> 00:18:08.350
if weâ€™re not doing the kind of things that
we need to do to counteract that part of the

227
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.359
spirit world.

228
00:18:09.359 --> 00:18:16.169
[Steve] That is the challengeâ€”counteracting
the dark influences that are all around us.

229
00:18:16.169 --> 00:18:22.009
It begins with subtle suggestion and enticement.
An evil thought is introduced into our mind,

230
00:18:22.009 --> 00:18:28.710
and if we donâ€™t change our thinking, the
desire motivates us to pursue it. The apostle

231
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:34.840
James said it this way: â€œBut each one is
tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires

232
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:41.269
and enticed. Then, when desire has conceived,
it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is

233
00:18:41.269 --> 00:18:49.129
full-grown, brings forth deathâ€ (James 1:14-15).
So we have to change the way we think.

234
00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:55.779
Now unfortunately throughout the centuries,
many have confused mental illness with demonic

235
00:18:55.779 --> 00:18:56.059
influence.

236
00:18:56.059 --> 00:19:01.710
[Dr. Fouch] Iâ€™ve been working in the field
with the severely, mentally ill for 35 years.

237
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:10.070
These people suffer terrible lives in many
cases. Itâ€™s important to not necessarily

238
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:16.679
assume that they are being influenced by demons
or that they are possessed. That we treat

239
00:19:16.679 --> 00:19:22.330
them as we would treat anybody who is suffering
from any condition. Throughout history people

240
00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:28.690
have been confounded by what mental illness
is. And so, theyâ€™ve reacted to these individuals

241
00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:34.529
as if they were demon possessed. They would
do things like bloodletting and drilling holes

242
00:19:34.529 --> 00:19:38.259
in their heads to try to release the evil
spirits.

243
00:19:38.259 --> 00:19:45.070
Thomas Aquinas, back in the 12th century,
a theologian, believed that it had to do with

244
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:50.269
demon possession or demon influence. And,
so what has happened through the course of

245
00:19:50.269 --> 00:19:54.570
time, some of these beliefs have continued
down through the ages.

246
00:19:54.570 --> 00:20:00.409
[Steve] We have to be careful about what we
assume. Godâ€™s Word teaches that evil forces

247
00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:06.179
can potentially influence all of us. Thatâ€™s
because Satan has the ability to transmit

248
00:20:06.179 --> 00:20:11.519
attitudes and tempting thoughts from which
no one is immune.

249
00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:15.739
Have you ever found yourself thinking an evil
thought and wondered, â€œWhere did that come

250
00:20:15.739 --> 00:20:22.619
from?â€ Weâ€™ve all heard the excuse, â€œThe
devil made me do it!â€ But the truth is,

251
00:20:22.619 --> 00:20:29.979
the devil canâ€™t make you do anything. But
he can make something wrongâ€”sound goodâ€”or

252
00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:35.659
seem so appealing, that youâ€™re willing to
choose to do it on your own. Maybe the saying

253
00:20:35.659 --> 00:20:40.600
should be: â€œThe devil tempted me to do it,
and I gave in.â€

254
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:46.479
[Dr. Fouch] You donâ€™t have to have a mental
illness to be influenced by demons. And I

255
00:20:46.479 --> 00:20:52.919
do think that people who have mental illness
are much more vulnerable to those influences

256
00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:57.999
because they donâ€™t seem to have much control
over the thoughts that come into their mind.

257
00:20:57.999 --> 00:21:03.229
[Steve] Do you think it would be fair to say
that itâ€™s not always chemical imbalances.

258
00:21:03.229 --> 00:21:08.440
That there actually is something for some
that is an effect of the spirit world?

259
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.879
[Dr. Fouch] Oh, absolutely. Not only people
with mental illness, but other people. So

260
00:21:13.879 --> 00:21:19.519
we can actually open that door ourselves by
some of the choices that we make.

261
00:21:19.519 --> 00:21:24.409
[Steve] Have you thought about some of the
ways that we open up ourselves to potential

262
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:31.070
influences? Is there a door in your life that
youâ€™re leaving open? Remember, itâ€™s about

263
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.889
your mind.

264
00:21:31.889 --> 00:21:42.080
[Dr. Fouch] I believe that when you talk about
ghosts, and things of that nature, and witches,

265
00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:48.149
and things along those linesâ€”things around
the occult, witchcraft, things like thatâ€”youâ€™re

266
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:55.419
definitely delving into the darker, spiritual
world. And, these things are presented in

267
00:21:55.419 --> 00:22:00.489
such an attractive way, that our children
are drawn to them and we encourage our children

268
00:22:00.489 --> 00:22:06.580
to be drawn to them. And these are things
that are part of the demonic world. Itâ€™s

269
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:13.600
part of the darker side of spirituality and
what Satan tries to do in my mind, is to sort

270
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:21.769
of dress it upâ€”make it looks like itâ€™s
fun, make it looks like itâ€™s okay. And yet,

271
00:22:21.769 --> 00:22:26.749
there are off shoots of this. So when you
start going in that direction, then you are

272
00:22:26.749 --> 00:22:34.639
definitely opening yourself up to demonic
influences. The more you access and interact

273
00:22:34.639 --> 00:22:40.090
with the spirit world on the dark side, the
more chance there is that something could

274
00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:42.190
get terribly out of control.

275
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:47.769
[Steve] But remember, itâ€™s not just about
ghosts and witches and the occult. The Bible

276
00:22:47.769 --> 00:22:53.320
leaves no doubt that Jesus believed that the
devil and demons exist and that they have

277
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.179
evil influence in and over human beings.

278
00:22:57.179 --> 00:23:02.869
Christ knew that these powers of darkness
are terrible forces of evil. No wonder He

279
00:23:02.869 --> 00:23:09.350
spoke of them with intensity and with authority.
He didnâ€™t hesitate to proclaim that evil

280
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:14.539
can be in our hearts and minds and it can
come from the very source of evil: Satan the

281
00:23:14.539 --> 00:23:15.759
devil.

282
00:23:15.759 --> 00:23:21.279
And so He warns us so we wonâ€™t be fooled.
Itâ€™s clear that: â€œThe devil who rules

283
00:23:21.279 --> 00:23:27.239
this world has blinded the minds of those
who do not believeâ€ (2 Corinthians 4, NCV).

284
00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:32.830
Now as strange as it may seem, heâ€™s convinced
people that he doesnâ€™t even exist and even

285
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:37.929
deceived the majority of people into false
religious worship. Theyâ€™ve perverted the

286
00:23:37.929 --> 00:23:45.729
knowledge of the One true Godâ€”even within
Christianity! Jesus taught us: Donâ€™t underestimate

287
00:23:45.729 --> 00:23:48.379
Satan and his demons.

288
00:23:48.379 --> 00:23:52.720
But it doesnâ€™t have to be that way. You
can protect yourself from the darkness around

289
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.950
you as you draw close to God.

290
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:59.509
[Dr. Fouch] If weâ€™re going to be influenced
one way or the other, I believe, because I

291
00:23:59.509 --> 00:24:05.379
think the spirit world does interact with
our physical realm. And so, if weâ€™re focused

292
00:24:05.379 --> 00:24:11.440
on connecting with the positive sideâ€”as
a Christian that would be connecting with

293
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:17.429
Jesus Christ, connecting with God the Father,
trying to follow Their instructions of how

294
00:24:17.429 --> 00:24:26.389
to become more like Themâ€”that that will
protect us. And making sure that you are constantly

295
00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:32.419
putting into your mind the things that God
talks about and thinks about. I think if we

296
00:24:32.419 --> 00:24:37.059
have minds that are more in tune with God,
there is less chance for our minds to be in

297
00:24:37.059 --> 00:24:45.849
tune with the dark side. If we are engaging
in sin on a regular basisâ€”pornography, addictions,

298
00:24:45.849 --> 00:24:52.519
drinking too much, doing things of that nature;
sinningâ€”I think anyone is more vulnerable

299
00:24:52.519 --> 00:24:53.479
to influence.

300
00:24:53.479 --> 00:24:59.409
[Steve] You can be receptive and choose to
let those wrong thoughts penetrate your thinking

301
00:24:59.409 --> 00:25:06.359
or you can choose to be different. All are
told to resist the dark forces of the spirit

302
00:25:06.359 --> 00:25:12.899
realm and â€œlet God transform you into a
new person by changing the way you think.

303
00:25:12.899 --> 00:25:18.559
Then you will learn to know Godâ€™s will for
you, which is good and pleasing and perfectâ€

304
00:25:18.559 --> 00:25:20.119
(Romans 12:2, NLT).

305
00:25:20.119 --> 00:25:25.080
Changing our thinking starts with repentance
and asking God to forgive us and to give us

306
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.789
the strength to overcome.

307
00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:33.700
So make the commitment today. Turn from the
darkness and ask God to help you build a strong

308
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.639
relationship with Him in the light.Â

316
00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:21.919
journey. We have hundreds of congregations

319
00:26:31.599 --> 00:26:32.359
each other.

320
00:26:32.359 --> 00:26:37.159
If youâ€™re looking for a home that encourages

321
00:26:37.159 --> 00:26:43.129
youâ€™ve found the right place! Weâ€™re a
familyâ€”a family of Bible believers committed

322
00:26:43.129 --> 00:26:49.299
to following Jesus Christ in everything we
do. Weâ€™ve found Godâ€™s way is the best

323
00:26:49.299 --> 00:26:50.559
way to live.

324
00:26:50.559 --> 00:26:55.039

328
00:27:09.929 --> 00:27:16.909
[Steve] Even though we canâ€™t see it, the
spirit world is very real. We know that Jesus

329
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:23.950
battled the powers of darkness and He won.
We can, too. He sacrificed His life so that

330
00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:26.960
we may live a life free from the spiritual
hosts of wickedness.

331
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:33.239
Now in this spiritual battle, letâ€™s make
the choice to fight against anything and everything

332
00:27:33.239 --> 00:27:35.809
that even hints of darkness.

333
00:27:35.809 --> 00:27:41.479
With His help, we can turn away from evil
influence to our loving God and the truth

334
00:27:41.479 --> 00:27:43.330
of His Word.

335
00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:47.679
